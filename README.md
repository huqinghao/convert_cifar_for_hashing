# convert_cifar_for_hashing
In terms of hashing and quantization, people usually split the cifar10 dataset to a training dataset containg 59000 images and a testing dataset contrain 1000 images. And Caffe is very popular with the Deep Learning is getting hotter.<br>
So We split the cifar10 dataset and save it to the LMDB which is the default dataset storage format of Caffe.
